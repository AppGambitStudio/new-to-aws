# New To AWS? 
Nowadays it's very difficult to imagine building an application that does not use any top Cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Many fresh or experienced engineers are rushing to learn these cloud services to either upgrade their skillset or build modern applications. 

If you are new to AWS, it can get overwhelming. There are 200+ services and many of them are interdependent and interconnected. I have put a list of core services and concepts that you can refer to and solidify your understanding of the AWS Cloud.

## Purpose
This repo is created for new AWS users to get enough familiarity with the core AWS Cloud services. The focus is on certain critical practices and core services to create a basic mental model that can help the account owners and users to use the AWS cloud safely and effectively.  

Over the years, I have seen many users (Developers or Account Owners) who create AWS accounts for themselves or their team and then quickly find themselves in one or other problems. Having a basic operational understanding of AWS Cloud goes a long way. 

## How to Use this Guide
For each service, I have put some basic explanations, mostly taken from the AWS documentation and other verified sources, and direct links to the documentation pages that the reader will have to go through step by step. 

The AWS documentation is the best source of detailed information. The documentation refererences may feel a bit boring and lengthy, but I have put only the required references that are critical for initial understanding. 

You can stroll around to different resources but do make sure to read through the referenced documentation first.
